# Discord Music Bot (babe)

A simple Discord bot that finds the most relevant music videos from YouTube based on user text commands and plays the audio in an audio channel. The bot supports pausing, resuming, and terminating playback. It's a hobby project made for my friend.


# Tech Stack & Frameworks
- NodeJs for run-time environment
- discord.js for creating local instance of the bot
- @distube/ytdl-core & @discordjs/voice for streming youtube audio
